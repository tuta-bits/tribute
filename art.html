        <p>
          When King Louis-Philippe was deposed in a revolt, the president elect, Charles Louis Napoleon Bonaparte, did not think much of Dumas. To avoid his creditors, Dumas escaped to Brussels, Belgium in 1851, and from there travelled to Russia, where French was the second language and his works were extremely popular. Dumas spent the next two years in Russia before leaving in search of adventure and story material. The kingdom of Italy was established in March of 1861, with Victor Emmanuel II as its king. Alexandre Dumas will spend the next three years fighting for an unified Italy before returning to Paris in 1864.

          Despite his achievements and aristocratic ties, Alexandre Dumas' mixed-blood status would follow him throughout his life. In 1843, he published Georges, a short fiction that dealt with race conflicts and the impacts of colonisation. Nonetheless, decades after his death on December 5, 1870, racist beliefs damaged his due place in French history.

        <h3>Posthumous Acclaim:</h3>
        <p>
          Alexandre Dumas was entombed in the Villers-Cotterets graveyard until November 30, 2002. His body was disinterred on the orders of French President Jacques Chirac, and his unique casket, accented with blue velvet fabric and guarded by four men decked as the Musketeers: Athos, Porthos, Aramis, and D'Artagnan, was carried in a solemn procession to the Pantheon of Paris, the wonderful mauseoleum in which French luminaries are entombed, in a televised ceremony.

          <p>
            "With you, we were D'Artagnan, Monte Cristo or Balsamo, riding along the roads of France, touring battlefields, visiting palaces and castles, with you, we dream."
          </p>
